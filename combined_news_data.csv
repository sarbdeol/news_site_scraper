This exciting program, known as TUI Colourful Cultures, will take place in Morocco. It is designed to celebrate and promote cultural diversity through the arts, providing a platform for new artists to shine.</p>",elevating-emerging-artists:-tui-care-foundation-unveils-dynamic-tui-colourful-cultures-programme-in-morocco,,"<p>Whilst Marrakech’s hospitality sector thrives and offers a growing number of employment opportunities, industries such as the arts struggle to attract and retain talent. To address this, TUI Colourful Cultures Morocco aims to preserve cultural heritage and empower creatives by offering artist residencies for creators from across the country and engaging young people in a comprehensive arts programme.</p>

<p>The initiative is launched in partnership with the Ali Zaoua Foundation and has already been implemented in several other Moroccan cities. It blends modern disciplines such as contemporary dance and street art with traditional Moroccan cultural elements such as traditional music, dance, and Arabic calligraphy. Seven local organisations collaborate to deliver the programme, which combines eight diverse disciplines.</p>

<p>Students will explore dance, vocal, and street performance, promoting traditional cultural heritage while also encouraging the evolution of Moroccan arts through modern influences. The programme bridges the gap between tradition and modernity, ensuring that Morocco’s cultural legacy continues to inspire and resonate for years to come.</p>

<p>The programme’s top performing students have access to a scholarship, in which twenty of the most promising participants will receive support to launch their entrepreneurial arts projects and turn their creative vocations into actual livelihoods.</p>

<p>TUI Colourful Cultures Morocco not only diversifies Marrakech’s cultural offerings but also provides local youth with professional opportunities in the arts. By addressing the undervaluation and low remuneration associated with artistic jobs, the initiative fosters an environment in which aspiring artists can thrive and secure viable means to support their families.</p>

<p>The programme is hosted at the Ali Zaoua Foundation’s Les Étoiles Jamaâ El Fna cultural centre in the heart of Marrakech. It involves the renovation of the historical riad with infrastructural add-ons that support the delivery of the arts programme and artistic residencies. This includes a brand-new sound studio for professional recordings.</p>

<p>In addition to the arts programme, the centre will create links with the tourism industry by hosting events which include live performances, exhibitions, festivals, and guided tours, welcoming 35,000 visitors across 50 events.</p>

<p>The project is part of the global TUI Colourful Cultures programme, which includes projects in destinations like Mexico, Peru, Croatia, and Zanzibar, empowering artists and artisans to gain access to new income opportunities and promote their cultural heritage through tourism.</p>",information/jysl5bpjYq.jpg,,,,27 Dec 2024,2024-12-30 08:50:10,27 Dec 2024,en,,,,,100.0,,,,,,,,,,
