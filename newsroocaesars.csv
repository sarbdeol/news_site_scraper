Jacob Claesson, CEO at Evolution North America, echoed Sunderland's sentiments, highlighting the uniqueness of the dedicated studio. “By combining our cutting-edge technology with the unmistakable Caesars brand, this dedicated studio will deliver the elegance and thrill of Caesars Palace to online players in Pennsylvania,” Claesson noted.
