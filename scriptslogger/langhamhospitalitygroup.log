Combined text content from <p> tags: Hong Kong, 25 November 2024 — For 17 years now, The Langham, Huntington, Pasadena, Los Angeles has been a mainstay of Langham Hospitality Group's (LHG’s) luxury portfolio, The Langham Hotels & Resorts. Starting in February 2025, the iconic property – a cherished institution that dates back to 1907 – will undergo an extensive renovation designed to enrich its historic grandeur with an artful infusion of contemporary sophistication. The meticulously planned upgrades will include redesigned interiors, enhanced outdoor spaces, and innovative new dining concepts – all carefully crafted to elevate the guest experience. “This is a monumental undertaking that will reaffirm The Langham, Huntington, Pasadena, Los Angeles’s position as a premier destination for timeless elegance and contemporary luxury, LHG Chief Executive Officer Bob van den Oord said. “On the one hand, we have a heritage building akin to something out of a fairy tale – We’ll be retaining that magic at all costs. On the other hand, we have a fantastic opportunity to enhance the property with the modern features and amenities that have made our latest hotels some of the most adored luxury accommodation destinations anywhere.”   Clockwise from top left: Exterior shot of The Langham, Huntington, Pasadena, Los Angeles; Top-view of the new Royce Pool; Renderings of the new Executive Club Suite and Superior Room. Room for contemporary opulence At the heart of the renovation lies the conversion of the hotel’s 362 guest rooms and suites, along with its eight private cottages. Conceptualised by acclaimed design firm Richmond International, the refreshed accommodations will carefully balance the hotel’s heritage with a sleek and modern aesthetic. Inspired by the Mission Revival architectural movement, the new rooms will feature a serene colour palette, hardwood floors, and mindfully integrated historical details. Oversized upholstered headboards will meanwhile serve as striking focal points, adding a touch of unbridled romance. The art of elevated taste The renovation will extend to the hotel’s celebrated drinking and dining venues, introducing an elevated take on beloved traditions. As a case in point, The Terrace will embrace a design that blends old Hollywood glamour with California’s breezy coastal lifestyle. The refresh will be complemented by a new farm-to-table menu featuring seasonal produce and fresh seafood. Also slated for upgrades, the Lobby Lounge – renowned for its Afternoon Tea service – will debut an elegant new design that celebrates The Langham’s signature British traditions. Alongside its refreshed interiors, guests can look forward to curated champagne experiences in a dedicated space purpose-built to toast special moments while enjoying delightful views of the hotel’s famed Horseshoe Garden. And for The Royce Grill, expect nothing short of a dramatic shift towards a moody and refined aesthetic with new focal points that include an exquisite bar area and an exclusive private dining space for intimate celebrations of fine steaks, artisanal pasta and exceptional wines. Not to be outdone, The Tap Room will receive its own share of updates, which will see it emerge as a must-visit bar for live music and classic American cocktails prepared to perfection. A groundswell of elegance The renovation will additionally focus on revitalising the hotel’s legendary outdoor spaces while preserving their timeless charm, which has captivated guests for generations. The iconic Horseshoe Garden and Japanese Garden, originally crafted by renowned landscape architect William Hertrich, will undergo thoughtful enhancements to enrich their natural beauty and create a more immersive sense of journey. Complementing these verdant spaces, the Lanai Pool – California’s first outdoor Olympic-size pool when it debuted in 1926 – will be restored with a design that celebrates Hollywood’s golden age. The new furnishings and refined details will align nicely with the recent renewal of the Royce Pool in August of this year.
